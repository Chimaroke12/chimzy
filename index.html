     <h3> Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
   <p class="purple-color"> 2020-present | Pro Level Developer</p>
 <p> I am the master of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I know everything needed to start a website function efficiently. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond the most popular JavaScript framework called Vue JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution. </p> 
    <p> They didnt offer me a job. But i made my website as a remote web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it and uploaded the content. It's fun working with Programming Hero</p>
